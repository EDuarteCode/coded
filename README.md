# Continuous Degredation Detection on Google Earth Engine (ge-cdd)

CDD is an algorithm developed to monitor for low-magnitude forest disturbances using Landsat data. The algorithm is based upon previous developments in continuous land cover monitoring [(Zhu and Woodcock, 2014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714000248) and tropical degradation monitoring using spectral unmixing models [(Souza et al., 2013)](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/11/5493/html) and is built upon the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) processing and data storage system.
