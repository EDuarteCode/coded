Background and Motivation
=========================

CODED is an algorithm developed to monitor for for forest conversion and degradation using Landsat data. The algorithm is based upon previous developments in continuous land cover monitoring [1] and tropical degradation monitoring using spectral unmixing models [2] and is built upon the Google Earth Engine processing and data storage system. CODED is designed to create a stratification for sample-based estimation of degraded forests.
